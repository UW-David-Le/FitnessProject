# Project Description 

This project was made using React.js, SASS , HTML and Node Js.Fitness is something we all know is great for us and includes benefits such as lower blood pressure, quality of sleep and protection against various diseases. Despite this, many people don't go because they find the gym extremely intimidating. YourFitnessBuddy (the name of my app) is here to lower that barrier to entry and make the fitness journey less daunting and more friendly for users.

# How the project was built 

The project workflow started with finding a simple and relatively easy API to workout that can form the basis of my application. This API allows us to dynamically render a bunch of workouts based off a muscle group. From there, I took inspiration from various workout websites and incorporated my own color scheme.

# Dependencies 

Make sure to run the command "npm i" before starting this application. This will install react and sass dependencies.
